# KarabinerElements
Various custom complex modifications for Karabiner Elements (they are actually called complex modifications, it's not me being pretentious).

## Modifications explained
### [★ Change keyboard brightness ★](https://github.com/matchadolly/KarabinerElements/blob/0cec137f3475fcec952a1bda7ef35708476f5a3e/%E2%98%85%20Change%20keyboard%20brightness%20%E2%98%85)
There's no native keyboard shortcut to change your keyboard backlight's brightness. I find that quite annoying. This modification lets you do that. You'll need to first go to "System Settings → Keyboard → Function Keys" and toggle "Use F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys" off. Then once you enable the modification, you'll be able to change your keyboard backlight's brightness by pressing fn + F1 / F2 (fn + F1 to lower the brightness, and fn + F2 to increase it).
### [★ Remap command-tab ★](https://github.com/matchadolly/KarabinerElements/blob/0cec137f3475fcec952a1bda7ef35708476f5a3e/%E2%98%85%20Remap%20command-tab%20%E2%98%85)
The ⌘-tab shortcut normally triggers the application switcher. Unfortunately, it is not a very good application switcher. On top of that misfortune, Apple will not let you use ⌘-tab for anything else. It is an incredible pity, because ⌘-tab is, in my opinion, an incredibly convenient shortcut; if I were the type of person to make a tier list of keyboard shortcuts (which I am not) it would be right at the top. I digress. This modification will remap ⌘-tab to ⇧⌃⌥⌘-tab, which effectively lets you use it for whatever you want - if you set a shortcut to ⇧⌃⌥⌘-tab, pressing the physical ⌘-tab keys will trigger that shortcut. I use it with Pieoneer; you could also use it with better application switchers like AltTab. Or any other app. Now that the ⌘-tab key has been unbound, the world is yours.
### [★ Remap right modifiers ★](https://github.com/matchadolly/KarabinerElements/blob/0cec137f3475fcec952a1bda7ef35708476f5a3e/%E2%98%85%20Remap%20command-tab%20%E2%98%85)
This modification will remap your right command key to ⇧⌃⌥⌘, and your right option key to ⇧⌃⌥. This will give you a whole bunch of additional keyboard shortcut combinations. If you set a shortcut to ⇧⌃⌥⌘ + H, for example, pressing your right command key + H will trigger that shortcut.
